# alicehan-midterm
- Midterm Report.pdf - my midterm report detailing my process
- midterm.ipynb - my main file, including my final submission code
- submission1.ipynb - code for my first submission; I was running it separately in google colab, so I needed a separate file
- testing_code.ipynb - file in which I tested different aspects of my code
